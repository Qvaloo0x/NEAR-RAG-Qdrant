# NEAR-RAG-Qdrant 🚀

This repository implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system specialized in the NEAR Protocol ecosystem. By leveraging Qdrant Cloud as a high-performance vector database and sentence-level embeddings, the system provides accurate, context-aware answers to complex blockchain infrastructure queries.
